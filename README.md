[![Travis Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/marionauta/strategies.svg)][1]

A Rust library that implements many algorithm-solving stategies so you don't
have to. You'll only need to define your problem.

**Note**: Although the use case for this library is _mostly_ academic, you can
use it for real world problems too.

### Implemented strategies:

- [x] Divide & Conquer
- [x] Divide & Conquer (with memory)
- [ ] more...

This is in early stages. Expect things to change.
